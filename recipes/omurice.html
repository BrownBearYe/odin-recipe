    <h2>Fried rice omelette</h2>
    <p>Fluffy, delicious omelette with rice. One that will make the Japanese queue for it!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tsp Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>50g Bacon, chopped</li>
        <li>1 Small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup Leftover cooked sushi rice</li>
        <li>2/3 cup (80g) Frozen corn and pea mix</li>
        <li>1 tbs Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>3 tsp Soy sauce</li>
        <li>6 Eggs</li>
        <li>2 tsp Milk</li>
        <li>Tonkatsu sauce, toasted sesame seeds and finely chopped and sliced red chilli, to serve</li>
    </ul>
    

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tsp oil in a large frypan over medium-high heat. Cook bacon, stirring occasionally, for 4 minutes or until golden.</li>
        <li>Add onion and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes or until softened.</li>
        <li>Add rice and vegetables and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until warmed through. Add tomato and soy sauce and stir-fry for 1 minute or until well combined. Cover to keep warm.</li>
        <li>Whisk eggs and milk in a large bowl until smooth. Heat a medium non-stick frypan over high heat until very hot. Add 1 tsp oil and swirl to coat pan. Pour half the egg mixture into the hot pan and immediately whisk egg mixture with 2 chopsticks in a small circular pattern until there is a thin base of cooked egg but remaining egg is still slightly runny. Remove from heat and slide out onto a serving plate. Spoon half the rice and vegetable mixture along centre, then fold egg up over slightly to cover.</li>
        <li>Repeat to make a second omelette. Drizzle with tonkatsu sauce, sprinkle with sesame seeds and chilli, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
