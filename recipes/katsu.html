    <img src="../image_recipes/katsu.jpg" alt="Chicken Katsu Picture">

    <h2>The perfect chicken katsu for your sandwiches!</h2>
    <p>The Japanese take on fried chicken. It's amazingly good and refreshing, give it a shot for your next lunch!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2x320g Chicken breast fillets</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (75g) Plain flour</li>
        <li>2 Large eggs, at room temp, whisked.</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (75g) Planko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice each chicken breast in half horizontally to create 4 thinner fillets in total.</li>
        <li>Place flour, eggs and panko in 3 separate shallow bowls. Dip chicken into flour, shake off excess, then dip into egg, then into panko, pressing down firmly to coat well. Transfer to a plate and chill for at least 30 minutes to set the crumb.</li>
        <li>Pour oil into a large saucepan to a depth of 5cm. Place pan over medium- high heat. Once oil reaches 170Â°C (a piece of bread will turn golden in 60 seconds), carefully deep-fry 2 fillets at a time, turning only once during frying, for 3-5 minutes or until deep golden and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Carefully transfer to a large plate lined with paper towel. Use in a sandwich or in a katsu curry.</li>
    </ol>
